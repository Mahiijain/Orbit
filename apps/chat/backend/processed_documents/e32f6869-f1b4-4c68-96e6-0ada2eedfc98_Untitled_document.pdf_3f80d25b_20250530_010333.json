In real-world customer deployments, engineers frequently \nencounter complex issues such as build failures, node hangs, \nperformance degradation, and configuration mismatches. Debugging \nthese requires domain knowledge and deep familiarity with logs, \nconfiguration files, technical manuals, and known issue databases, \nwhich is an effort-intensive and error-prone process, particularly for \nnew or remote engineers.\nOur solution is a scalable, low-latency chatbot built using Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). The \nsystem ingests structured telemetry and unstructured data from \nvarious sources. Logs were collected using Fluent Bit and streamed in \nreal time via Apache Kafka, whereas documents such as PDFs and \nDOCs were parsed using Apache Tika. All data were preprocessed and \nembedded into a semantic vector store (Qdrant) with Redis-based \ncaching to speed up frequent queries. A React-based frontend with \nauthentication enables seamless user interaction, and the LLM \nbackend generates accurate, context-aware responses by fetching \nrelevant chunks from the knowledge base.\nThis architecture can be hosted on HPE’s scalable infrastructure, \nparticularly HPE GreenLake for hybrid cloud deployment and HPE \nEzmeral for containerized data workloads, ensuring high availability, \ndata locality, and compliance across customer environments. In the \nfuture, we plan to extend the solution with code-based understanding \n\n\n\ncapabilities. By embedding source code repositories (such as Git) and \nindexing functions, stack traces, and file contexts similar to Cursor.dev, \nour chatbot can evolve into a unified assistant that resolves \nenvironment-level bugs and suggests fixes within the code.\nEnterprise service engineers face recurring technical challenges, such as \nbuild errors, node hangs, system crashes, incorrect configuration settings, \nand performance degradation. These issues typically require navigation \nthrough extensive logs, user manuals, and knowledge bases. Engineers new \nto a specific environment or lacking domain expertise face longer resolution \ntimes, impacting SLAs and customer satisfaction. There is a strong business \nand technical need for an automated system that can quickly surface \nrelevant information and suggest solutions tailored to the customer’s \nenvironment.\n\nThis innovation addresses that need through an intelligent, context-aware \nchatbot that assists engineers in resolving LCM issues in near real time, \ndirectly impacting HPE’s support services efficiency and customer trust.\n\nOur solution leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture \npowered by LLMs. Key components include:\n\nThe data ingestion layer consists of two primary components: Fluent Bit for \nstreaming logs and Apache Tika for extracting text from unstructured files, \nincluding PDFs and DOCs.\n\nApache Kafka ensures reliable and fault-tolerant data streaming between \nvarious components of the\n\nsystem.\n\nThe extracted data were embedded into Qdrant, a high-performance vector \ndatabase optimized for semantic search operations.\n\nRedis caches frequent queries to minimize the latency and improve the \nsystem responsiveness.\n\nA React-based frontend provides user interaction capabilities with \nintegrated, secure authentication mechanisms.\n\nThe backend processes natural language queries and fetches relevant \ncontexts from the vector database to generate accurate responses.\n\nFigure 1: System Architecture Diagram\n\n\n\nThis pipeline ensures the modularity, scalability, and real-time relevance of \nuser queries across enterprise environments.\n\nThe system processes data from multiple sources, including structured logs, \nenvironmental metadata, and unstructured documents.

Apache Kafka ensures reliable and fault-tolerant data streaming between various components of the system. The extracted data were embedded into Qdrant, a high-performance vector database optimized for semantic search operations. Redis caches frequent queries to minimize the latency and improve the system responsiveness. A React-based frontend provides user interaction capabilities with integrated, secure authentication mechanisms. The backend processes natural language queries and fetches relevant contexts from the vector database to generate accurate responses.

Splunk AI Assistant: Provides LLM-based assistance for logs, metrics, and traces but lacks integration with customer-specific documents and does not implement RAG architecture.

IBM Watson AIOps: Utilizes machine learning and semantic graphs with document ingestion capabilities but lacks a conversational interface and requires heavyweight setup procedures. Our solution is distinguished by three key factors: comprehensive handling of both structured and unstructured data, open and flexible architecture design, and specialized optimization for domain-specific hybrid cloud use cases. A functional prototype was developed and tested using internal datasets. Full deployment in the sandbox environment is currently in progress, and the initial results show promising performance metrics. We plan to add codebase embeddings for enhanced debugging capabilities, similar to the functionality provided by Cursor.dev, which enables direct code-level issue resolution.
